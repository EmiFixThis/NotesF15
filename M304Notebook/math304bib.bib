  abstract =	 {Here's a quick reference `cheat' sheet for theory
                  people which I've been working on. It has most of
                  those formulas which I always forget and have to
                  look up in books, notes, etc.... Most of the
                  material is out of Concrete Mathematics, but not all
                  of it. Some of it is just amusing. I'm sure that
                  there are still typos in it. It's all done in TeX,
                  except for one postscript picture. It needs to print
                  on a PostScript printer. I can send you the TeX
                  source if you want, but it's messy. If you find it
                  useful, or spot any typos, or have suggestions for
                  additions, let me know. I don't really want to
                  distribute it widely until most of the errors are
                  found. Steve PS. Of course I should really be
                  working on research, but when I get bored or stuck,
                  this gives me something constructive to do.},
